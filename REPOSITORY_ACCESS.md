# üîê LevlStudio Repository Access Guide

## üö® **Repository Protection Options**

GitHub doesn't support password protection for individual repositories, but here are several alternatives to restrict access:

## **Option 1: Private Repository (Recommended)**

### **Make Repository Private**
1. Go to repository settings: `https://github.com/borngifted/LevlStudio_Project/settings`
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone"
3. Click "Change repository visibility"
4. Select "Make private"
5. Type repository name to confirm

### **Add Collaborators**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Collaborators and teams
2. Click "Add people" 
3. Enter GitHub usernames or email addresses
4. Set permission level (Read, Write, Admin)

### **Access Control**
- Only invited collaborators can view/clone
- You control who has access
- Can revoke access anytime

## **Option 2: GitHub Organization with Teams**

### **Create Organization**
1. Go to https://github.com/organizations/new
2. Create organization (e.g., "LevlStudio-Team")
3. Transfer repository to organization
4. Create teams with different access levels

### **Benefits**
- Fine-grained permission control
- Team-based access management
- Professional appearance

## **Option 3: Deploy Keys (Read-Only Access)**

### **For Read-Only Access**
```bash
# Generate SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/levlstudio_readonly

# Add public key to repository
# Settings ‚Üí Deploy keys ‚Üí Add deploy key
# Paste ~/.ssh/levlstudio_readonly.pub content
```

### **Clone with Deploy Key**
```bash
# Configure SSH
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/levlstudio_readonly

# Clone repository
git clone git@github.com:borngifted/LevlStudio_Project.git
```

## **Option 4: Access Token Authentication**

### **Personal Access Tokens**
1. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token with repository access
3. Share token with authorized users

### **Clone with Token**
```bash
# HTTPS clone with token
git clone https://github.com/borngifted/LevlStudio_Project.git
# Username: your-github-username  
# Password: your-personal-access-token
```

## **Option 5: GitLab/Bitbucket Alternative**

### **GitLab Private Repository**
- Create account at https://gitlab.com
- Import from GitHub
- Set repository visibility to "Private"
- Add users with specific roles

### **Bitbucket Private Repository**
- Create account at https://bitbucket.org
- Import from GitHub
- Configure workspace permissions
- Invite team members

## **Current Setup Instructions**

Since GitHub repositories can't have passwords, here's how users should access:

### **üîí Access Method: Private Repository**

**Repository URL**: `https://github.com/borngifted/LevlStudio_Project`

**Access Requirements**:
- GitHub account required
- Must be added as collaborator
- Request access from repository owner

### **Clone Instructions**

**ü™ü Windows:**
```cmd
# SSH (after being added as collaborator)
git clone git@github.com:borngifted/LevlStudio_Project.git

# HTTPS (with GitHub credentials)
git clone https://github.com/borngifted/LevlStudio_Project.git
```

**üçé macOS:**
```bash
# SSH (after being added as collaborator)
git clone git@github.com:borngifted/LevlStudio_Project.git

# HTTPS (with GitHub credentials)
git clone https://github.com/borngifted/LevlStudio_Project.git
```

## **Recommended Solution**

For maximum security and control:

1. **Make repository private**
2. **Add specific collaborators**
3. **Use SSH keys for authentication**
4. **Monitor access in repository insights**

This provides:
- ‚úÖ Complete access control
- ‚úÖ Audit trail of who accessed when
- ‚úÖ Ability to revoke access instantly
- ‚úÖ Professional repository management

## **Alternative: Website with Password Protection**

If you need password-protected access, consider:

### **GitHub Pages with Netlify**
1. Deploy to Netlify from GitHub
2. Enable Netlify password protection
3. Set password: `Ibu/ubI`
4. Users access via web interface

### **Self-Hosted Solution**
1. Host on your own server
2. Add HTTP Basic Authentication
3. Set username/password protection
4. Provide direct download links

## **Implementation Steps**

Choose your preferred option and follow these steps:

### **Private Repository (Fastest)**
```bash
# 1. Make repository private in GitHub settings
# 2. Add collaborators by email/username
# 3. Update documentation with access instructions
```

### **Organization Setup**
```bash
# 1. Create GitHub organization
# 2. Transfer repository 
# 3. Set up teams and permissions
# 4. Invite team members
```
